text based blackjack program in python:
The code has a very basic text (hopefully legible) interface, but supports:

- multiplayer play
- multideck shoes
- splitting (one split max per player)
- insurance
- doubling down
- blackjack pays 2:1 (generous, *integer* payouts)

Thank you for letting me submit it late...I had a very challenging project that just completed last Friday, and was only able to start with this on Sunday. The extra time allowed me to add features and document the code.
